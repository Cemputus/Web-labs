## Lab2 Activity Report: Understanding the Internet and Web Browsing

---

### Part 1: Understanding the Internet

#### 1. Introduction to the Internet:

The internet serves as a vast network connecting millions of computers worldwide, fundamentally altering how we communicate, work, and learn. Its continuous evolution is a testament to its significance in shaping modern society.

#### 2. Internet Infrastructure:

The internet's infrastructure comprises both physical and logical components. Routers, servers, and cables work together seamlessly, forming a complex network that facilitates efficient data transfer between connected computers.

#### 3. Internet Protocols:

Internet protocols are sets of rules governing computer communication. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) are crucial. TCP/IP manages data packet transmission, while HTTP retrieves and displays web pages.

### Part 2: Web Browsing and Basic Navigation

#### 1. Web Browsers:

Web browsers, such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, are software applications that translate HTML code into the visual elements seen on screens. They enable users to access and interact with web pages.

#### 2. Launching a Web Browser:

Opening a web browser is a simple task. Users can click on the browser icon or launch it from the Start menu, initiating their online journey.

#### 3. Navigating the Web:

Navigation involves entering URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) into the browser's address bar. URLs include a protocol (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS), a domain name (e.g., www.google.com), and a path (e.g., /search), uniquely identifying web pages.

### Part 3: Practical Activity - Exploring Web Pages

#### 1. Accessing Websites:

Accessing a website involves typing its URL into the browser's address bar. The browser then retrieves the website's HTML code and transforms it into a visually comprehensible page.

#### 2. Examining Web Pages:

Web pages consist of HTML code, a markup language defining their structure and content. Browsers offer features like "Inspect" or "View Page Source" to view this underlying code.

#### 3. Browser Developer Tools:

Most browsers provide built-in developer tools, aiding in debugging and analyzing web pages. These tools offer insights into HTML code, CSS styles, and potential issues.

### Part 4: Topic Summary - The Creation of the World Wide Web

#### 1. Introduction to WWW:

Invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989, the World Wide Web (WWW) serves as an information system, allowing users to access hypertext documents and multimedia globally.

#### 2. Background:

Berners-Lee envisioned a universal linked information system. He proposed using HTML as a simple markup language to define the structure and content of web pages.

#### 3. Development of the WWW:

In 1990, Berners-Lee developed the first web browser (WorldWideWeb) and server (CERN httpd). He defined HTTP as the communication foundation between web browsers and servers.

#### 4. Release of the WWW:

Announcing the WWW's existence in 1991, Berners-Lee made the necessary software public. By 1993, over 100 web servers were operational, marking a rapid growth in WWW usage.

#### 5. Impact of the WWW:

The WWW has revolutionized communication, information access, and business, creating new industries and job opportunities. It continues to shape our interconnected world.

#### 6. Conclusion:

The creation of the World Wide Web is a historic event that democratized information access globally. Its ongoing evolution suggests it will play an even more crucial role in shaping our future.
